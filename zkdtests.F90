!some sudo code
!gram looks like a name to call the program by so make this.
!add all dependencies
!not sure what implicit is

!add subroutine to do are calculation:
!write finised ie learn how write function works

!create the functrion you called earlier to do the calculation

!again not sure what implicit is
!reserve memory for all needed variable and outputs? so learn how variable are made in fortran
!then initiallize all inputs taht are scalar
!next initiallize all matrix and vectors
!learn how for loops and if statements work in fortran
!end function and in theory feel proud

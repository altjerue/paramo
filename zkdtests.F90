!some sudo code
!gram looks like a name to call the program by so make this.
!add all dependencies
!not sure what implicit is

!add subroutine to do are calculation:
!write finised ie learn how write function works

!create the functrion you called earlier to do the calculation

!again not sure what implicit is
!reserve memory for all needed variable and outputs? so learn how variable are made in fortran
  !--outputs are managed by using the intent(out)
  !--intent doesn't appear to be needed if it is not a parameter or variable that leaves
!then initiallize all inputs taht are scalar
!next initiallize all matrix and vectors
!learn how for loops and if statements work in fortran
  !--looks like you can name for loops adn if you do you end with end do NAME
!end function and in theory feel proud
